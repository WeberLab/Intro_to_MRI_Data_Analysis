# Intro_to_MRI_Data_Analysis

Every time I get a new student, I am faced with having to teach them the basics of neuroimaging methods...

and usually I point them to the lab wiki, or send them a bunch of links to some tutorials

but I decided it might be nice to customize a lot of those, and to have it all in one place

The main file you will want is **Intro_to_MRI_Data_Analysis.pdf**

However, I have included the **Intro_to_MRI_Data_Analysis.md** file I used to create it, and the **md2pdf.sh** I used to convert the .md to .pdf

Let me know what you think, or if you find any mistakes. Everyone is welcome to use/share/whatever
